      <p>My lover's got humor
      <br>She's the giggle at a funeral
      <br>Knows everybody's disapproval
      <br>I should've worshiped her sooner
      <br>If the Heavens ever did speak
      <br>She is the last true mouthpiece
      <br>Every Sunday's getting more bleak
      <br>A fresh poison each week
      <br>"We were born sick", you heard them say it
      <br>My church offers no absolutes
      <br>She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
      <br>The only heaven I'll be sent to
      <br>Is when I'm alone with you
      <br>I was born sick, but I love it
      <br>Command me to be well
      <br>Amen, Amen, Amen</p>
      <p>Take me to church
      <br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
      <br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
      <br>Offer me that deathless death
      <br>Good God, let me give you my life</p>
      <p>Take me to church
      <br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
      <br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
      <br>Offer me that deathless death
      <br>Good God, let me give you my life</p>
      <p>If I'm a pagan of the good times
      <br>My lover's the sunlight
      <br>To keep the Goddess on my side
      <br>She demands a sacrifice
      <br>To drain the whole sea
      <br>Get something shiny
      <br>Something meaty for the main course
      <br>That's a fine looking high horse
      <br>What you got in the stable?
      <br>We've a lot of starving faithful
      <br>That looks tasty
      <br>That looks plenty
      <br>This is hungry work</p>
      <p>Take me to church
      <br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
      <br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
      <br>Offer me that deathless death
      <br>Good God, let me give you my life</p>
      <p>Take me to church
      <br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
      <br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
      <br>Offer me that deathless death
      <br>Good God, let me give you my life</p>
      <p>No masters or kings when the ritual begins
      <br>There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
      <br>In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
      <br>Only then I am human
      <br>Only then I am clean
      <br>Amen, Amen, Amen</p>
      <p>Take me to church
      <br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
      <br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
      <br>Offer me that deathless death
      <br>Good God, let me give you my life
      <br>Take me to church
      <br>I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
      <br>I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
      <br>Offer me that deathless death
      <br>Good God, let me give you my life</p>
